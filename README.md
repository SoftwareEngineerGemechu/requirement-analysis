# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository provides an overview and resources related to the process of Requirement Analysis in Software Development. It covers key concepts, best practices, and documentation templates to help understand and implement effective requirement gathering, analysis, and validation.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented. This process involves identifying the functional and non-functional requirements that the software system must fulfill. The primary goal is to ensure a clear understanding between stakeholders and the development team to build a system that meets business objectives and user needs.

Importance of Requirement Analysis includes:

- Defining clear and unambiguous requirements to guide development.
- Preventing scope creep by setting boundaries for what the system will deliver.
- Reducing risks and costs associated with changes later in the development process.
- Enhancing communication among stakeholders, developers, testers, and project managers.
- Providing a foundation for designing, coding, testing, and maintaining the software.

Effective requirement analysis helps deliver a successful software product that satisfies both user expectations and business goals.
